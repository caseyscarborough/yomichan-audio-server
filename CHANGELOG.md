## v1.3.3
- Show the time for regenerating the database and for generating the Android database

## v1.3.2
- Added condition in `__init__.py` to only run if it was imported by Anki

## v1.3.0

## v1.1.1

## v1.0.0
**Major code rewrite:**
- Reworked database format so all sources are now in one giant table, and so one query can get all audio sources correctly
- Separated code into different files, including one for each source

**Other:**

- Fixed JPod + JPod Alt audio sometimes not being fetched because the query does not account for empty expressions or readings
    - Kana only words are stored with both expression and reading being filled (as the same thing)
    - Expression only words are stored without reading i.e. (null)
- Uploaded to ankiweb
